Compounds that are synthesised in OSTB should be given an OSTB number, whether biologically evaluated or not. The letter after "OSTB" should indicate the city in which the compound was made, e.g. OSTBS for compounds made in Sydney. No hyphens. For any compound assigned a number the Chemdraw file (or equivalent) and a picture file (.png) should be added to the shared Dropbox folder (contact to request access rights) which will put them in the relevant folder in this repo, sorted by Series number. Settings in Chemdraw are "Wiley" but use existing examples as a guide.
